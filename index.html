		<h2>History of Dumfries</h2>
		<p>Dumfries history began as early as 1690 when Richard Gibson erected a gristmill on Quantico Creek. The Town of Dumfries was formally established on 60 acres of land at the head of the harbor of Quantico Creek, provided by John Graham. He named the town after his birthplace, Dumfriesshire, Scotland.

			The General Assembly established Dumfries as the first of seven townships in Prince William County. The Town received its charter on May 11, 1749, making it the oldest continuously chartered town in Virginia. By 1749, many second and third generation Virginians settled in Prince William County. Although many continued to identify as British, few North American born Virginians travelled to Europe, and so began to view themselves unique among the British Empire.</p>

		<h2>Culture</h2>
		<p>A treasure house of history in Dumfries and Galloway, Dumfries Museum tells the story of the land and people of the region. Look out for fossil footprints left by prehistoric animals, the wildlife of the Solway, tools and weapons of our earliest people, stone carvings by Scotlandâ€™s first Christians and the everyday things of the Victorian farm, workshop and home. The museum also hosts a lively programme of special exhibitions, events and family activities throughout the year and has a shop selling unusual and nostalgic toys, gemstones, gifts and books.   Through the winter months 2022-23, Dumfries Museum is open as a warm space.  Everyone is welcome to spend a few hours exploring, and we have a space to sit and relax or read, with books provided.  Just ask if you would like a free hot drink while you're at the museum.  The museum is open Tuesdays through to Saturdays 10am-4pm.   The Camera Obscura is within Dumfries Museum.  This is weather permitting.  Some restrictions remain in place for the purpose of Covid safety.  A charge for entry applies for the Camera Obscura which is only accessible by steps.</p>

			Temporarily closed The castle grounds, shop and toilets are open (the castle remains closed) and we are delighted to welcome you back. With its moat, twin towered gatehouse and imposing battlements, this awe-inspiring castle is the epitome of the medieval stronghold and one of the finest castles in Scotland. Although ruined, Caerlaverock is still a substantial structure and you can explore many different features within its unique triangular ground plan. The castle's turbulent history owes much to its proximity to England which brought it into the brutal cross-border conflicts and you can enjoy a fascinating siege warfare exhibition complete with reconstructions of medieval siege engines.
